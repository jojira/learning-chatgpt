I. Your Ability Profile
Your HAB results were determined by using timed worksamples and are reported as percentile ranking
scores. Worksamples are performance-based rather than self-report assessments. Percentile ranking
scores are your score relative to tens of thousands of others in the Highlands database of test takers.

Your results from the HAB are displayed below. When accessing this HCES online, you can click on any
of the abilities below to find examples of how that ability can be used in a variety of work roles/career
fields. Doing this can help you better understand an ability; it is not meant to suggest a specific job or
occupation.

This report emphasizes how combinations of abilities work together. The combinations are unlimited.
Once you learn the basic combinations or building blocks you can combine them yourself to create
additional careers not mentioned in this report! You’ll be able to integrate these combinations with
your interests, values, and goals any time you want to expand or redesign your career path.

II. Your Personal Style
Between Administrator and Detailed Researcher
As a mid-range Generalist-Specialist, you may find it difficult to
identify with any one style. You are a natural interpreter between
extreme Generalists and extreme Specialists and will tend to do so
one-on-one. Your Introversion pulls you toward working alone or in
small groups. You prefer to carry out your thought processes by
yourself and to bring a cohesive idea or product to the group for its
comments and reactions. You are often perceived as working behind
the scenes, although you are able to function as part of a team
when needed.

You will likely find a good fit with tasks that allow you to work
individually, delving into your project or assignment, and then
present your finished product to your team. Group projects where
tasks are assigned and work is completed without much supervision
will be most comfortable to you. It will be more comfortable for you to receive edits or input from
team members in writing. You may enjoy roles where you take on specific tasks for the benefit of the
whole team such as marketing, writing, research, planning or organizing a specific project or working
one-on-one with clients.


Time Frame Orientation



Intermediate: Combined with an intermediate completion date (1-5 years), work that requires
relationship building or patience with a 1-5 year process before achieving an ultimate result may feel
more motivating and meaningful.

You are drawn to activities that take time to achieve. You may feel that immediate, short-term tasks
may hold little meaning to you unless you can see the connection to something you care about in the
future. You are naturally able to hold 1-5 year goals in your mind, and you have the patience to work
toward and see your activities as helping you achieve that goal. Examples are developing long term
clients for a product (sales of large machinery or capital investments for the organization), working on
a building project that may take several years to complete, researching and writing a book, working
toward an advanced degree to forward your career. Work or educational responsibilities that require
patience with a 1-5 year process or building more meaningful relationships will probably feel like a
good fit.




III. Your Reasoning Abilities
Problem Solving (Convergent Reasoning)

Between Diagnostic and Consultative
Your strong Classification and mid-range Concept Organization
indicate you arrive at solutions quickly and often base your
conclusions on facts that may appear to others as seemingly
unrelated bits of information. Once a plan is devised, or a solution
adopted, you prefer moving on to confront the next problem.

Your problem solving style draws you toward fast-paced
environments where your ability to rapidly diagnose problems are
encouraged. It may, however, take you a little longer to explain your
conclusions to others. You may also be interested in a debriefing
after decisions are made to analyze logical support for future
choices.


Idea Productivity (Divergent Reasoning)
Your mid-range Idea Productivity results in the ability to both generate new ideas and to discriminate
among a large flow of ideas to select one or two. You might excel as the leader of meetings at which
ideas are produced and exchanged. You probably will be most effective in careers that draw on your
strength in producing your own ideas, in encouraging others to produce theirs, and in facilitating the
discussion about the selection of ideas that lead to a plan or solution. You may be able to handle
several projects simultaneously, although you may have some difficulty maintaining a single focus over
a prolonged period of time.

This means you would feel most comfortable in a career that values the ability to discern between
many random ideas and one or two really great ones. Work roles that require the ability to come up
with differing ways of resolving a situation or creating a new approach yet being able to accept the
ideas of other and focus on a solution would be most satisfying to you.




Spatial Reasoning

Between Spatial Creating/Engineering and Spatial Building
Your mid-range SRT and strong SRV indicate you relate best to the
physical or structural world and have a preference for concreteness
in your work. You know how to make and build tangible projects
and objects and you are also capable of understanding why things
need to be designed or produced in a particular way. In simple
terms, you understand naturally the “how” of things and you are
able to implement the “why”. As a result, you are able to follow
instructions and set to work because you understand the concepts
or theories that resulted in the product they’re working on.

You will be drawn to work that allows you to physically handle
materials. You may be interested in the reason behind the task,
but completion of the project in the real world will be your goal.
You may enjoy work roles in”hands on” fields such as
construction, landscaping, farming, mechanical repair, surgery, dentistry, computer hardware
development and construction, architecture, product development, and many others.


IV. Your Specialized Abilities
Some Musical Influences. Music abilities include Tonal Memory, Rhythm Memory and Pitch
Discrimination. Your combination of scores indicates you have some natural musical ability. You will
want to have some connection to these abilities such as learning to play an instrument on your own,
taking part in some musical expression like a choir, playing music in the background while you study
or work, or incorporating music into events or presentations. Depending on which one or two of these
abilities is strongest, you may be more sensitive to particular elements of sound and may find
alternative outlets.

Moderate Visual Proficiency. Visual proficiency (or dexterity) includes both Visual Speed and Visual
Accuracy. Your combination of scores indicates moderate visual ability related to paper work tasks.
Your natural inclination is to emphasize accuracy over speed when proofing, working with numbers,
coding, or tracking inventory.

Reasonable Language Learning. Your ability to learn another language is primarily influenced by
your Verbal Memory (learning the vocabulary and grammar from books) and your Tonal Memory
(learning from hearing). Your Rhythm Memory and Pitch Discrimination can also influence your ability
to replicate how the language sounds. Your combination of scores indicates you have a moderate
natural ability to learn a foreign language. The combination of using books and hearing the language
being spoken will facilitate your learning.



Somewhat Influential Creative Orientation. The HAB does not have a direct measure of creativity
or artistic ability. The combination of Idea Productivity (thinking of many ways of doing something),
Design Memory (remembering the overall pattern of something), and Pitch Discrimination (a sensitivity
to small nuances of change and the effects of such a change) indicate a creative or artistic orientation.
In addition to visual art, these abilities allow you to be creative with any kind of task you do. Your
combination of scores indicates you have a moderate natural artistic/ creative orientation and you will
want to choose work roles and other activities that allow you to express your creative side without
making that the main function of your role.





V. How You Learn

  Kinesthetic Learning            Using physical movement is a primary learning tool for you

  Low     Med High
                                  Work at increasing your vocabulary
                     55%          Learning the written portion of a foreign language is relatively moderately
                                  strong
                                  Communicating in writing can be a positive experience


  Learning By Listening           Remembering what you hear will be relatively easy for you
  Tonal Memory                    Utilize lectures, podcasts, and discussions to learn new information
  Low     Med High
                                  Learning a foreign language through speaking and listening can be relatively
                                  easy for you
                     50%
                                  Including some music in your life can be a positive experience
                                  Spoken communications, whether face-to-face or over the telephone are likely
                                  effective means for communication


  Learning Numbers                Remembering essential numbers and data is relatively easy for you
  Number Memory                   May not be conscious of the importance of remembering numbers
  Low     Med High
                                  Can use this ability when you have to remember details quickly
                     40%          Have some advantage in roles requiring working with numbers
                                  Use this ability to arrange schedules and time tables


  Image Learning                  Recalling images or details on a map, chart, or graph may be difficult for you
  Design Memory                   Convert pictures and graphs into lists, memos or notes
  Low    Med High
                                  Avoid work roles that depend on remembering details from graphics
                     30%          Depend on others’ expertise concerning the design of things
                                  Use mnemonic devices (memory aids) to recall shapes and forms




VI. Vocabulary
Your general vocabulary provides you with the foundation for the breadth and depth with which you
learn and communicate. Vocabulary is a personal tool developed by each individual over time, rather
than a natural ability, but the range of your vocabulary will affect how effectively you can use some of
your abilities. The Highlands Ability Battery tests vocabulary in isolation, which means there are no
context clues in a paragraph to help you know what a word means, only a group of synonyms from
which to choose. Many universities/colleges require an adequate general vocabulary for entry, and
yours will be measured further by entrance exams and potentially later for entry to graduate school.

For adults, a strong general vocabulary can be a gateway to working with a wider variety of fields,
working with more sophisticated clients or in professional fields that require the usage of a wider
range of communication. A strong vocabulary can even influence gaining access to opportunities at
higher levels of career development (management, supervision, teaching at graduate levels, law).

Regardless of your current vocabulary level, knowing how to develop your vocabulary can help you.
Many careers require a specific or technical vocabulary, so discovering how you best learn new words
and ideas will support you in any career you choose. Also, over time, focusing on the development of
a specialized or technical vocabulary may divert developing and/or practicing your general vocabulary
which may decline with disuse. If you ever decide to increase your vocabulary, use your most efficient
learning channels (Design Memory, Verbal Memory, Tonal Memory, Rhythm Memory, and Number
Memory) to assist you with building this skill.

Your General Vocabulary score is in the high range. This indicates a broad general knowledge that
affects your outlook in any work situation. You can think of Vocabulary as measuring both the number
and precision of categories that you have for taking in, processing, and communicating your
experiences. As a result, all of us are usually most at home with others who are at about the same
Vocabulary level that we are. Although you can certainly communicate with a wide range of other
people, you may find that it would be stressful for you to spend most of your day with others who are
markedly lower in Vocabulary than you are. Your score is typical of high.level executives, people in
literary and academic fields, diplomats, negotiators, and those at the top of many professions. You can
think of your vocabulary as providing the driving force behind your career. This means that you should
be able to rise to very high levels in any organization.

           Ability Patterns:
           Manage The Fit Between You And Your Work

           Ability Patterns describe how your abilities interact. They reveal your natural approach to
           completing roles and responsibilities and are not tied to a single occupation.

           Rather than considering one ability at a time, think of your Patterns as a way to customize
           or manage the fit between you and your work. By discovering your Patterns, you can modify
           or enhance your current job, change roles within your career field, and identify similar roles
           in new fields.

           Over time, many satisfied (and dissatisfied) workers look for ways to emphasize and
           deemphasize particular aspects of their employment. Understanding your Patterns equips
           you with solid evidence for the changes you might want to make -putting you in the driver’s
           seat of your career.

Troubleshooting - Hands-on

This pattern utilizes Diagnostic Problem Solving
(Classification) within the structural world. Spatial
Relations Visualization is at the foundation of this
pattern and is the first ability to take into account.
Strength in this ability means greater satisfaction when
involved in and with the three dimensional world. You
will experience more satisfaction in any activity, whether
as an avocation or as part of your work, that has a
`hands on' feel to it, and brings you in contact with the
real world.
                                                                              Abilities Constituting This Pattern
Classification drives people with this pattern to solve
problems quickly and well; communicating rationales or ideas to other people may present more of a
problem. They often enjoy functioning in a problem solving, or troubleshooting role and thrive on
having different types of problems to work on. People with this pattern often `see' the answer much
more quickly than others, and can feel impatient at times unless they consciously make allowances for
other people's problem solving styles. With your combination of strong abilities, you will in all
likelihood be most satisfied and happy when you are using them regularly.

This combination of driving abilities is seen quite often in
people who operate in environments that require on-the-
spot decisions, and a sense of certainty. People who are
                                                                100

involved in direct, hands-on problem solving, and
technicians who do frequent troubleshooting all use this
pattern of abilities. In addition, it is often seen in people
                                                                                        •

Writing - Specialized/Detail

This pattern combines the Detailed Researcher personal
style (Introverted Specialist) with focused, hands-on
Analytical Problem Solving style (lower Idea Productivity,
Spatial Relations Visualization, Concept Organization)
and attention to visual details (Observation). People
with this pattern are able to organize what they want to
say and put it in a logical form, which others can
understand. They can express the information in a
concrete way and may easily use real examples. They
also understand machines or technical processes well
enough to explain them to others. Observation of details                Abilities Constituting This Pattern
brings life to writing, and can also help with editing
technical writing for important details. The technical writer is more straightforward than the creative
writer, so a writer with higher Idea Productivity might be bored with the restrictions of technical
writing.

Specializing - Hands-on

The combination of physical activity (Rhythm Memory),
working with tangible items or concrete facts (Spatial
Relations Visualization) and the personal style of a
Specialist points to the basic pattern of Specializing-
Hands-on. People with this pattern find outlets on and
off the job and can include leisure activities such as
cooking, baking, or working on cars. When Spatial
Relations Visualization is very strong, it almost always
points to a career or work role that involves some
hands-on activities as part of your daily work tasks.
                                                                                Abilities Constituting This Pattern
People with strong Spatial Relations Visualization also
tend to be more concrete thinkers, meaning they like things that have a tangible or finished product
outcome. Typically, people with this pattern are more comfortable in fields that are supported by facts
and figures or black or white outcomes versus theories and ideas that have no verifiable outcome or
basis. Because of this, many are drawn to technical, mechanical, scientific, medical, or sometimes
artistic fields.

The Specialist orientation often points to choosing a                 100         100          100
narrower or specialized field where a natural drive will lead
to a depth of knowledge. This specialization will most
likely make you more proficient and possibly an expert.

Your interest and education will be very important in
deciding which industry you work in but the key is to look

Investigating - Planning

This pattern combines a Specialist orientation with a
Consultative problem solving style (Classification and
Concept Organization), an ability to remember what is
read (Verbal Memory) and acute Observation. People
with this pattern naturally apply their foot-wide/mile
deep approach to seeing details that others might miss
and then quickly ascertaining how the pieces fit
together. This combination results in a natural
attentiveness to visual details related to plans, progress
toward goals, or the creation of a scenario from limited
pieces of visual information.                                                  Abilities Constituting This Pattern

This complex set of abilities enables you to conduct investigations and inquiries. You are a logical
thinker, able to take what you have observed and make the connections needed to begin the
investigation. Next, you can create a plan of action and then communicate the results. Verbal Memory
allows you to sift through written material and retain information. This is helpful as you use the
diagnostic side of your problem solving (Classification) to make connections with information you have
read.

You have strong abilities for investigation and work
roles in criminal justice or the legal profession. Many
other occupations might interest you as well. This ability

Planning - Hands-on

This pattern utilizes Analytical Problem Solving (Concept
Organization) within the structural world. Spatial
Relations Visualization is at the foundation of this
pattern and is the first ability to take into account.
Strength in this ability means greater satisfaction when
involved in and with the three dimensional world. You
will experience more satisfaction in any activity, whether
as an avocation or as part of your work, that has a
`hands on' feel to it, and brings you in contact with the
real world.
                                                                                Abilities Constituting This Pattern
With strong Concept Organization, people with this
pattern are able to solve problems most easily by projecting logical consequences into the future. This
ability also enables them to communicate ideas to other people in a way that they can easily
understand. People with this particular combination of abilities often enjoy functioning in a planning
role. They are able to deal with problems in a rigorous, logical and linear manner that lends itself
easily to projections and forecasting the future.

With your combination of strong abilities, you will in all      100              100
likelihood be most satisfied and happy when you are using
them regularly. This combination of driving abilities is seen
quite often in work roles requiring the anticipation of

Specializing - Science

This pattern combines the Detailed Researcher Personal
Style (Specialist Introvert), with convergent reasoning
abilities (Classification and Concept Organization), the
spatial abilities (Spatial Relations Theory and Spatial
Relations Visualization) and the ability to notice visual
details (Observation). The foundation of this pattern is
the ability to solve tangible problems by analyzing the
available data and diagnosing the cause. Understanding
the ways systems interact and the ability to see visual
details gives those with this pattern an advantage in any
science career.                                                                          Abilities Constituting This Pattern

Specialists with these four driving abilities often have a unique way of looking at life. With the addition
of Introversion, people with this pattern typically have a thirst for knowledge in their areas of interest
and spend a good amount of time researching those topics on their own. The Specialist side brings
focus in a specific field of study, and a preference for introversion brings comfort in scientific
environments such as laboratory work and solitary field experiments.

Science specialists influence others
with their depth of technical

Specializing - Structural Consultative Problem Solving

This pattern combines a Specialist orientation, a
Consultative Problem Solving style (Classification and
Concept Organization) and the ability to engineer or
design in three dimensions (Spatial Relations Theory
and Visualization). With a natural consultative problem
solving style, people with this pattern are typically
drawn to work roles requiring fast-paced
troubleshooting or solution identification within
structural industries. You might want to begin your
career on the design or implementation team in a
structural design or engineering firm. This will give you             Abilities Constituting This Pattern
the necessary experience to be seen as the expert you
desire to be. Seeking to remain in the structural, tangible world and not allowing yourself to be thrust
into a more theoretical managerial position will be important for your development. Because of your
Specialist orientation you would be more successful as a consultant rather than a long-term manager,
allowing you to advise from outside the ranks. However, if you are an Extrovert, the energy you gain
from working with people might compensate for your Specialist orientation on a team and you would
naturally be seen as a leader.

score the more pressure you will feel to use it. It can

but ultimately a more complete use of your considerable
talents.

Pinpointing Details

This pattern combines the in-depth focus of a Specialist
with the rapid problem identification of a Diagnostician
(Classification) and a heightened sensitivity to sensory
experiences (Pitch Discrimination), especially visual cues
(Observation). It represents both a way of thinking and
a foundation for certain careers. Classification, which is
the diagnostic reasoning ability, is the ability to see
patterns and relationships among seemingly unrelated
elements. With the natural ability to almost instantly
notice what is wrong or inconsistent with normal
expectations, people with this pattern can quickly assess               Abilities Constituting This Pattern
and draw conclusions. As a Specialist, there is an
intense focus on the specific details. This ability is required in many careers where there is limited time
to gather information and convert it into an understandable pattern.

People with this pattern might also have the tendency to
see problems in every situation, and if left un-checked,
may be considered pessimistic or negative. Observation,

Introversion/Extroversion can influence your comfort with        Your Scores (black dots) Relative To Required Ability Range
work roles and work environments when utilizing this
pattern. For instance, if you are more of an Introvert, look
for opportunities where interaction with others is mainly through written communication such as
reports, articles, or dossiers. A career such as an editor, critic, or political analyst might be more
comfortable for you. As an Extrovert, you might feel the need to interact with others verbally, and that
need might be supported through presentations, consultations, or discussions. You might want to
investigate a career as a negotiator, investigative journalist, or financial planner.

Motivating - Physical

This pattern combines the personal style of a blended
Generalist/Specialist with idea-rich planning (Idea
Productivity, Concept Organization) and relatively strong
Visual abilities (Design Memory, Observation) in the
physical, sensory and hands-on world (Rhythm Memory,
Pitch Discrimination, Spatial Relations Visualization).
Those with a Motivating- Physical pattern are able to
develop and/or communicate a flexible plan of action
that requires physical energy. Based on what they see
and sense, they can modify plans on the spot using Idea
Productivity. A mid-range generalist-specialist                                           Abilities Constituting This Pattern
orientation allows for flexibility in translating specialized
information to less knowledgeable participants.

People with this combination of abilities will like to pursue goals by motivating others to achieve. As a
physical motivator, you prefer an applied relationship with clients rather than a theoretical or abstract
one. This means that focusing on how to change a client’s motivation and helping to implement that
change feels more important than theorizing why a client needs motivation.

Problem Solving - Hands-on Diagnostic

This pattern combines Diagnostic Problem Solving
(Classification) and a rich flow of ideas (Idea
Productivity) within the structural world (Spatial
Relations Visualization). The combination of several
strong driving abilities means that people with this
pattern have very powerful abilities in many diverse
areas of functioning. A potential problem with this is
that it is nearly impossible for any one job to use all of
these talents. It is generally true that we experience
dissatisfaction on the job, not because of abilities we
do not have, but because of abilities we do have that                 Abilities Constituting This Pattern
we are not using. The wide variety of strong abilities in
this pattern suggests the need to seek outlets off the job as well as on. Think of your career in terms
of expansion. At any given step, think of how you can use the experience and expertise you are
gaining now to move to a wider area of influence. You may wish to develop one or more themes to
your career, so that when you move from one area to another, you move along a related path of jobs
or careers.

Spatial Relations Visualization is at the foundation of this pattern and is the first ability to take into
account. Strength in this ability means greater satisfaction when involved in and with the three
dimensional world. You will experience more satisfaction in any activity, whether as an avocation or as
part of your work, that has a `hands on' feel to it, and brings you in contact with the real world.

Classification drives people with this pattern to solve
problems quickly and well; communicating rationales or
ideas to other people may present more of a problem.
                                                               100

of problems to work on. People with this pattern often
`see' the answer much more quickly than others, and can
feel impatient at times unless they consciously make
allowances for other people's problem solving styles.
                                                                0                 0               0

since it allows you to come up with many possibilities.         Classification

This can help in situations in which there is a premium on
the speed of resolution rather than on explaining. Your
Idea Productivity can also drive you to seek variety in your   Your Scores (black dots) Relative To Required Ability Range

 should be or do                                options to determine the best fit

 There is one “right”, “best” or “ideal”        It is important that I understand my profile and how to
 ability profile                                best use my strengths

 There is a perfect job/career                  There is a job or career path that may fit me now and
                                                as I grow in my career

 There is only one way to do a job              What is my best way of accomplishing specific job
                                                responsibilities

 Jobs don’t change                              Because jobs and careers can change, I need to be
                                                aware of how my strengths fit and what, if any, skills I
                                                need to build

 Personal circumstances don’t change            Because personal circumstances can and do change I
                                                need to be aware of my personal style and abilities to
                                                learn to adapt to changing circumstances

 The right job will just show up                I need to take action and explore options


Explore Your Interests
Abilities and interests go hand in hand. Abilities provide the potential for doing things well and
interests provide the motivation and energy to use those abilities. Most of the time, a strong ability
will assert itself and you will use it in a variety of ways without ever thinking about it. Sometimes,
however, a strong ability may remain dormant due to lack of interest in applying it or lack of
experience in using it. Conversely, a strong interest can provide the motivation to develop a particular
skill even if your aptitude is low or moderate.

Take playing basketball as an example. Those who have a natural ability to play, and an interest in
doing so, may play the game well with little effort. Those who have the natural talent and have never
tried playing may not know their capability, while others with this natural talent may have no interest
in playing. Either way, their natural talent for playing basketball will not be demonstrated. There is also
a group of people who become very good basketball players through practice, practice, practice even
though their natural talent is low to moderate.




If you’ve never explored your interests or if you are curious about the alignment of your abilities with
your interests, you can begin by going to the free Interest Inventory published by the US Department
of Labor on the O*Net website at http://www.mynextmove.org/explore/ip . The O*NET is the nation’s
primary source of occupational information. You can also work with your Highlands Affiliate who may
have additional inventories and activities to explore your interests.


Seek Out Experiences Or Talk To People With Experience
Building self-awareness is key to your success. Success in college, success in the world and how much
you enjoy your life will be determined by how well you know yourself. Knowledge about your natural
abilities is at the foundation. Knowledge about other internal factors is key.

Awareness of how each factor works for you and how all factors work together will only come from
seeing them in action. That’s why proactively seeking out experience is critical.

You may consider volunteer work, clubs, committees, work-study programs, co-op programs, job
shadowing, informational interviewing/surveying, part-time jobs, community service, and non-credit
classes. You can tinker with computers, machines, equipment, instruments, artistic mediums, and other
hands-on materials. You can run for office in a club, try your hand at public speaking or perform in a
school or community play. Whatever experiences you have will help you expand or refine your career
exploration.

Alternatively, take every opportunity you get to talk to people who are working in career fields that
interest you. Develop a list of questions that will help provide you with the information you need to
expand or narrow your search. Whether you take advantage of job fairs and speakers, or ask friends
and family for people to talk to, this is an important way to gather realistic information and may even
provide additional avenues to explore.
